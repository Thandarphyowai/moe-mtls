The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) is an annual event co-organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the three Mother Tongue Language Learning and Promotion Committees (MTLLPCs), with the support from the Early Childhood Development Agency, the Lee Kuan Yew Fund for Bilingualism, Singapore Press Holdings and the National Library Board.

Into its seventh year, MTLS 2018 will continue to promote bilingualism and strengthen efforts by schools and the community in the teaching and learning of our Mother Tongue Languages amidst Singaporeâ€™s increasing number of English-speaking families.
