The Mother Tongue Languages Symposium(MTLS) is an annual event jointly organised by the Ministry of Education(MOE), the Committee of Promote Chinese Language Learning(CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee(MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee(TLLPC).

Now into its eighth year, MTLS 2019 will continue to develop a keen sense of lifelong learning for our Mother Tongue Languages and strenghten the nexus between families and our community partners as part of the larger efforts to create a vibrant MTL ecosystem.
